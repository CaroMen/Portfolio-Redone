I decided to combine my passion of helping people and my love for data structures and algorithms together. I emplemented user authentication, added graphs to show user progress of Leetcode problems, displayed solutions for each problem, and created a random problem generator that wuold help the user challenge themselves.',

For a lot of self-taught students, algorithms and data structures are one of the most challenging concepts to take on. I wanted to create a website that would help a user understand what areas they need to target more and get a deeper understanding of their progress based on categories and difficulty level of the questions in my database.',
    stackchosen1: 'For this project, I utilized Python/Flask for the backend and React for the frontend. I utilized Heroku because it provides Heroku Postgres. I had the ability to completely design the website myself and I opted to keep a clean, minimalistic look. In the future, I hope to add an IDE that would allow users to store their own solution for each problem.',
    lessons1: 'The most intricate part of this project was formatting the solutions to each problem a certain way for them to be formatted correctly in the codeblock. I was able to also design an algorithm from scratch to generate random problems regardless of the category or difficulty level that the specific user had not already marked as solved. It was a lot of fun designing my own algorithm for a project I created to help people study DSAs.'
