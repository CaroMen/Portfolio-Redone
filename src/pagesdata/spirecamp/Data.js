The phases tackled include implementing user authentication, displaying user posts, allowing users to book a location, and allowing users to search based on popular states, activities, and accommodations that benefit people mentally.',

I\'m a big believer that being outdoors can provide a huge relief to anxiety and that attracted me to replicate what HipCamp was already doing. I just wanted to give a big focus on the mental health part and,  instead of just showing regular campsites, give a platform to places that serve as a retreat as well.',
    stackchosen1: 'For this project, I wanted to continue practicing using Express for the backend while utilizing React for the frontend. I\'ve had previous experience with React, but never had a backend for it. I had freerange of the design and I opted to create my own design. In the future, I hope to add more functionality to users, allow them to edit/delete their rentals, and allow users to create their own hosting.',
    lessons1: 'While I enjoyed having the freedom to create my own design, it was also challenging in the time frame I was given. Had I decided to follow the HipCamp design, it would\'ve taken much less time. This was a big opportunity to push myself and build a user friendly website from scratch under a strict time limit. I was able to get a lot more comfortable using Redux and learned to keep my schema as simple as possible.'
