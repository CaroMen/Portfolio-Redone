    pOne: "I'm a mostly self taught developer and made the decision to focus on software development in 2019. During my last two years at Baylor, I spent a lot of time working with Python and found out I enjoy working on technically complex and challenging problems. Since 2019, I've spent my free time studying Python, JavaScript, working with React and creating full-stack applications. I decided to pursure further education in programing by attending App Academy where I spent 6 months in an intensive 6 month program focusing on full-stack applications. Programming has become an outlet for me, so I'm passionate about teaching others about what amazing things programming can do for you.",
